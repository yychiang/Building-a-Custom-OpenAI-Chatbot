# Building-a-Custom-OpenAI-Chatbot

## Installation

To create an environment named chatbot in Anaconda with Python version 3.9 and install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, follow these steps:

1. First, open Anaconda Prompt.

2. Next, use the following command to create a new environment named chatbot and specify Python version 3.9:

```
conda create --name chatbot python=3.9
```

3. Once the environment is created, use the following command to activate it:
```
conda activate chatbot
```

4. With the environment activated, you can now install the dependencies listed in the **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/yychiang/Building-a-Custom-OpenAI-Chatbot/blob/main/requirements.txt)** file. Place the **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/yychiang/Building-a-Custom-OpenAI-Chatbot/blob/main/requirements.txt)** file in the current directory or a location that's easy to find, then use the following command to install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will create an Anaconda environment named `chatbot` and install all necessary dependencies to meet the requirements specified in the **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/yychiang/Building-a-Custom-OpenAI-Chatbot/blob/main/requirements.txt)** file. Make sure your Anaconda Prompt is pointed to the directory containing the **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/yychiang/Building-a-Custom-OpenAI-Chatbot/blob/main/requirements.txt)** file, or you need to provide the full path to the file, when performing these steps.
